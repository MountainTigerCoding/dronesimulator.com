            It's been a while since the last update and a lot has happened since then.
            I have been mainly developing the user interface but also continued to work on the landscape, river/lakes, snow, day/night cycle and automating aspects of level design like placing rocks and trees.

<!-- What is the User Interface? -->
        <h3 id="blog-heading">What Is a User Interface?</h3>
        <div class="blog-user-interface-grid">
            <h4 class="blog-user-interface-intro-zero">
                UI refers to all the elements on screen that allow the user to interact with the application. It commonly consists of buttons, text, sliders, icons, menus etc.
                I originally set up a simple UI at the beginning but it was cobbled together and had several technical limitations.
                <br><br><br>
                All of these problems made adding a new UI a slow and increasingly complex process. So, I decided to start again. Here are some samples of parts of the project that have received (mostly) working UI. You can click on the images below to view a short preview of how they function.

<!-- Style and Feel -->
        <h3 id="blog-heading">Style and Feel</h3>
        <h4>
            One feature that was essential to include with this UI update was a style guide system. This allowed me to change all the UI aesthetics from one place, keeping the UI colours and sizes coherent and flexible. <a id="hyperlink" href ="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> (the game engine I'm using) doesn't come with a built-in style guide/theme system, so I had to code my own. With this system, I plan to include an accessibility option to switch from the default system to one that has extra contrast or is colour blind friendly.
            <br>
            Currently all the colours and shapes are just placeholders as I haven't come up with a unique UI style. This will come with time as the project gets developed.
        </h4>

<!-- Other UI Feature -->
        <h4 id="blog-heading">Other Features</h4>
        <h4>A common feature that most applications have is a tooltip. This is simply a message that gets displayed when hovering over certain objects.</h4>
        <img src="blogs/user_interface/tooltip.gif" id="blog-image-frame">

        <h4>I also added a generic dialogue box which can be customised to ask questions or get inputs from the user (text field, checkbox, slider)</h4>
